# Anima — Character Format Specification

> Format: YAML  
> Version: 2.0 — the mechanism-rig format the Python runtime loads
> (`animacore/loader.py` is the reference implementation). The 1.0

A character file defines the identity and movable structure of an Anima character. It is authored once per character and referenced by scene files. The same character file covers both digital and physical output.

## Format 2.0 — mechanism rig

A 2.0 character is a mechanism: rigid `parts` connected by typed
`joints` (mates, in the Onshape sense), plus generic 0..1
`parameters`, keyframed `clips`, DOF-coupling `relations`, and
target → channel `outputs`. Units in files are operator units —
degrees for rotation, meters for translation — converted to radians
and meters in every runtime model. Unknown fields anywhere are load
errors: reject, never silently drop.

> **K2/K5/K9 contract.** The `limits` block, the `relations` list, and
> the joint `offset` block below are the shared kinematics contract
> from `Kinematics.md` (§2 limits, §5 relations, §4 offsets). Swift
> `AnimaCore` must mirror these semantics exactly (Codex's K-packets);
> the Python loader/rig already implements them.

### Parts — the assembly of rigid bodies

A character is an **assembly** of rigid parts (the parametric-assembly
paradigm, not a skinned mesh): each part is a rigid body backed by its
own imported geometry, mated together by `joints`. A part carries two
independent, fully **opaque** geometry references — the runtime stores
and round-trips both but never opens or parses either, so STL, OBJ,
STEP, USD, and any other format are treated identically:

- `model` — a relative path to the part's asset **file** within the
  character's `assets/` folder (e.g. `assets/head.stl`,
  `assets/robot.usdz`). Optional; empty when the part has no geometry
  of its own. It must be a **safe relative** path: an absolute path
  (leading `/`), a `..` traversal segment, or an empty segment
  (leading/trailing/doubled `/`) is a load error naming
  `parts.<name>.model`, so a character folder stays portable.
- `model_node` — an optional node path **within** a multi-node file
  (e.g. a subtree of a USD stage); null/absent for a single-mesh file
  like an STL.

The two combine freely: a **multi-file assembly** gives each part its
own `model` and no `model_node`; a **single multi-node USD** gives
several parts a shared `model` plus distinct `model_node`s. Asset paths
resolve against `characters/<name>/assets/` (see `Project_Format.md`);
the app copies an imported mesh there on import and sets the part's
`model`. `parent` is optional assembly-tree metadata — kinematic
connectivity lives in `joints`, not here.

### DOF limits (optional per DOF — K2)

- `limits` is an optional block: `{ min_deg, max_deg }` on a rotation
  DOF, `{ min_m, max_m }` on a translation DOF. Present limits are
  hard stops: `min < max`, the neutral must lie inside them, and
  evaluation clamps clip values to them (load rejects out-of-range
  keyframes outright).
- **No `limits` block = unbounded DOF** (a wheel keeps spinning).
  Evaluation never clamps it. The DOF entry must then declare its unit
  family through an explicit `neutral_deg` / `neutral_m` — neutral is
  always required, limits are not.
- An unbounded DOF **cannot be an `outputs` target**: a bounded
  actuator channel needs a range to project to 0..1. That mapping is a
  load error naming the fix (add limits or remove the mapping) — never
  a silent clamp or default. Continuous actuators lift this later
  (B08).

### Mate controls (universal — K4/K9)

Every mate — all eight kinds — carries the same optional universal
controls (`animacore/mates.py` `MateControls`); only the DOF set
differs per kind, so the UI binds one panel and reads the DOF slots
from the `mate_types` bridge verb. All fields are optional with
sensible defaults (a mate with none is legal, and the runtime models
its `controls` as absent):

- `id` — a stable tracking id (e.g. `"Fastened 33"`), distinct from
  the editable joint key/name and preserved verbatim; empty is allowed
  (the app assigns it).
- `connectors: { a: {...}, b: {...} }` — the two aligned mate connector
  frames. Each is a `part` (must be declared) plus an oriented frame:
  `origin_m: [x, y, z]`, `primary_axis` (connector Z, the mated axis),
  `secondary_axis` (connector X, the reorientation reference), a
  `flipped` bool, and an opaque `feature` provenance string. Axes must
  be non-zero and non-parallel. Either side may be omitted.
- `offset` — the Onshape-style as-mated offset applied before DOF
  values: `enabled` (the dialog checkbox), `translation_m: [x, y, z]`,
  `rotate_about` (`x`/`y`/`z`), and `angle_deg` (degrees in the file,
  radians in the model). It shifts the zero pose spatially and consumes
  no DOF.
- `flip_primary_axis` — reverse the mate's primary axis.
- `secondary_axis_rotation_deg` — reorient the secondary axis in 90°
  steps; must be one of `0 | 90 | 180 | 270`.
- `simulation_connection` — the Onshape "simulation connection" toggle
  (default `true`).

The headless runtime computes DOF values and channel projections, not
spatial part transforms, so it stores connectors and the offset for
round-trip only; **Studio consumes them spatially.**

### Geometry-constraint mates — `width` and `tangent`

Beyond the eight kinematic mates above there are two **geometry-
constraint** mates whose placement depends on real surface geometry.
That geometry lives in the app (RealityKit), not in the abstract
engine, so the engine recognizes and round-trips them and exposes them
in the `mate_types` catalog (with `category: geometry_constraint`,
`drivable: false`), but their geometry is resolved app-side. Both are
0-DOF — they carry no `dofs` block. See Kinematics.md "Mate categories".

**`width`** — center a tab part symmetrically between two faces of a
width part (midplane to midplane). Onshape allows **no offset** on it.
It reuses the connector controls (its two connectors are the app-
computed midplanes) plus `flip_primary_axis` / `simulation_connection`,
but **not** `offset` or `secondary_axis_rotation_deg` (both are load
errors on a width). Once the app supplies the two midplane connectors
the engine resolves it exactly like a 0-DOF fastened at the centered
position.

```yaml
joints:
  center_tab:
    type: width
    id: "Width 1"              # optional stable tracking id
    parent: frame
    child: tab
    connectors:                # the two app-computed midplane frames
      a: { part: frame }
      b: { part: tab }
    flip_primary_axis: false   # optional
    simulation_connection: true
    # NO offset, NO secondary_axis_rotation_deg, NO dofs (all rejected)
```

**`tangent`** — force two surfaces (face/edge/vertex) to stay in
contact. It uses **no mate connectors** and **no offset**; its free DOF
are geometry-dependent, and Onshape advises against using it as a
driving mate. The engine has no geometry kernel, so it is **deferred /
non-driving**: it round-trips a `tangent` block and, in pose
resolution, leaves the child at the parent frame (Studio resolves the
actual contact).

```yaml
joints:
  cam_contact:
    type: tangent
    id: "Tangent 1"            # optional
    parent: cam
    child: follower
    tangent:                   # required; opaque app-side surface ids
      selection_a: "cam/lobe_surface"
      selection_b: "follower/roller_surface"
      propagation: true        # optional (default true)
    # NO connectors, NO offset, NO dofs (all rejected)
```

Worked example: `examples/geometry_mates_demo.character.anima` (a driven
revolute plus a width and a tangent mate).

### Relations (K5)

`driven_value = ratio × driver_value + offset`, evaluated after driver
DOF resolve from the clip/pose, in dependency order (chains are legal).

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `gear` (rot→rot), `rack_pinion` (rot→trans), `screw` (rot→trans, same mate allowed: cylindrical), `linear` (trans→trans). The kind fixes the driver/driven DOF kinds; mismatches are load errors. |
| `driver`, `driven` | DOF paths (`"<joint>.<dof>"`); must resolve to declared DOF |
| `ratio` | required, nonzero signed float, **model units**: driven model unit per driver model unit (unitless for gear/linear; meters per radian for rack_pinion/screw). The one semantic value. |
| `offset_deg` / `offset_m` | optional (default 0); the key must match the driven DOF's kind; file units, converted to model units |
| `display` | optional, non-semantic round-trip fields per kind: gear `driver_teeth`/`driven_teeth`, rack_pinion `pinion_diameter_mm`, screw `lead_mm_per_rev`; positive numbers. No consistency with `ratio` is enforced. |

Rules (load errors, never silent fixes):

- The relation graph is **acyclic** and each DOF is driven by **at
  most one** relation.
- A driven DOF may not carry animation tracks — one source of truth
  for its motion.
- **Limits never clamp a relation.** The relation always computes; a
  driven value outside its enabled limits is reported as a limit
  violation on the evaluated pose (`Pose.limit_violations` in the
  Python runtime), and projecting a violated mapped DOF to a channel
  raises (`LimitViolationError`) — hardware must refuse to arm while
  violated.
