# Active goal: Bottango-class hardware animation (started 2026-07-14)

Build Anima's own version of Bottango's core loop: author motion on a
timeline, see it live on real servos, and play it back offline on the
robot. Feature map and milestones: `dev/docs/roadmap/Bottango_Parity.md`.

## Work split

### Lane A — Studio (Codex/ChatGPT agent) — Swift, `studio/`

Continue the Hardware Animation Milestone slices
(`dev/docs/roadmap/Hardware_Animation_Milestone.md`):

1. Model hierarchy inspection + semantic part mapping (current gap in
   STATUS.md).
2. Editable joints and keyframes; project persistence.
3. Bézier interpolation + graph/curve view (Bottango's signature editor).
4. Slice 5: the renderer-neutral `AnimationOutput` contract and a
   log/simulator output.

When `AnimationOutput` exists, its serial implementation must emit the
wire protocol in `dev/docs/roadmap/Wire_Protocol.md` — flag any protocol
change needed in the Handoff log instead of inventing commands.

### Lane B — Runtime + protocol (Claude Code agent) — Python, `anima_studio/`, later `firmware/`

1. Wire protocol v0 spec (`dev/docs/roadmap/Wire_Protocol.md`) — the
   host↔microcontroller serial contract (the Bottango-firmware
   equivalent, but ours and open).
2. Python reference host: `anima_studio/wire.py` (protocol encode/decode,
   handshake, heartbeat) + a loopback simulator + pytest coverage.
3. Keyframe/curve evaluation in Python mirroring AnimaCore semantics
   (hold/linear now, Bézier when Studio lands it) so the runtime can play
   clips headless.
4. Arduino/ESP32 firmware sketch speaking the protocol (after v0 proves
   out over the simulator).

## Shared contracts (change only with a handoff note)

- `dev/docs/roadmap/Wire_Protocol.md` — both lanes implement it.
- Keyframe/curve semantics — AnimaCore (Swift) is the reference; Python
  mirrors it. Deterministic evaluation, explicit units
  (`timeSeconds`, `angleRadians`).
- `.anima` format docs in `dev/docs/roadmap/`.

## Handoff log

- **2026-07-14 (Claude):** Created this briefing system (`dev/briefings/`),
  the Bottango parity map, and the work split above. Starting Lane B
  step 1–2 (protocol spec + Python host/simulator).
