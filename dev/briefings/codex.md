# Codex mailbox

Role (see AGENTS.md → Team roles): **planning + review**. Claude Code
does the heavy implementation; Codex reviews it and plans what's next.

## IN — tasks & messages for Codex (others write here; Codex checks off)

- [x] 2026-07-14 (Claude): Conflict resolution, not a silent revert —
  your AGENTS.md edit declared mailbox files "intentionally avoided,"
  but Jonathan explicitly requested claude.md/codex.md IN-OUT files
  this session. Resolved as a hybrid (recorded in AGENTS.md): mailboxes
  carry directed messages/tasks; your Live claims + Requests + Handoff
  log in the goal file stay authoritative for file ownership. Object
  here if you disagree.

- [x] 2026-07-14 (Claude): Roles updated per Jonathan — you own planning
  + review. The master list we're working down is
  `dev/docs/roadmap/Bottango_Parity.md`. Please review the ordering and
  correct anything you'd sequence differently.
- [x] 2026-07-14 (Claude): Review `dev/docs/roadmap/Wire_Protocol.md`
  (the host↔MCU serial contract) — especially: is device-side linear
  interpolation + host-side curve sampling the right split for the
  Studio `AnimationOutput` you have planned in Slice 5? Flag protocol
  changes here, don't fork the spec.
- [x] 2026-07-14 (Claude): Review the new Python lane once it lands
  (`anima_studio/wire.py`, `sim.py`, `clips.py` + tests) — in
  particular that `clips.py` evaluation semantics match AnimaCore
  (hold/linear, time + limit clamping) so Swift and Python never
  disagree about what a clip plays.
- [x] 2026-07-14 (Claude): Plan the next Studio slice from the checklist
  §4 (Bézier + graph view) and §2 (editable joints, part mapping) —
  write the plan as tasks in `claude.md` → IN, since Claude implements.

## OUT — Codex's replies, review findings, plans (Codex writes here)

- **2026-07-14 — next Studio sequence:** Do not jump from the simulator to
  serial output yet. The dependency order is P0 durable project → P1 imported
  hierarchy/semantic parts/editable joints → P2 editable curves → P3
  actuator mapping and serial output. The first Claude packet is assigned in
  `claude.md` IN.

- **2026-07-14 — runtime review:** 74 tests pass and Ruff is clean. The
  device-linear/host-curve split is accepted: FRM interpolation is a transport
  ramp, while Studio/runtime sample the authored curve. Before integration,
  fix three deterministic/safety edges: malformed traffic currently resets
  the failsafe; duplicate CFG keys and duplicate FRM channels silently resolve
  last-write-wins; and `clips.py` is not yet an exact AnimaCore mirror because
  it requires a non-empty normalized 0...1 track and has no rig neutral
  fallback, while Swift evaluates joint radians for every rig joint and permits
  empty tracks. Detailed acceptance is also in the active briefing Requests.

- **2026-07-14 — planning review:** Accepted the mailbox hybrid. The B01–B13
  map follows Bottango's documentation areas, but delivery is deliberately
  dependency-ordered P0–P5 rather than menu-ordered. This prevents hardware
  APIs or graph UI from freezing an unpersisted rig model.
